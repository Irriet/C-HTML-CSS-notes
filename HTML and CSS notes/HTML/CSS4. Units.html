    <title>Notes on CSS - Units</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Units</h1>
    <h2>Absolute units</h2>
    Those are not affected by anything around them, nor by the device.
    <ul>
        <li>cm</li>
        <li>mm</li>
        <li>inch</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Special units</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            px - it's absolute, but relatively scaled. It's the DPI that's used to calculate the resolution.
            Pixels appear a bit different on high and low resolution devices: they are smaller on high resolution ones.
        </li>
        <li>pt - a bit bigger than px</li>
        <li>pc - a lot pigger than px, it's 12 * pt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Relative units</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>percentage %</li>
        <li>em - if font size is x, 2em is going to be 2x. It's a proportion value, relative to the standard font size.</li>
        <li>view width and height - 70vw would be 70*1% of the total viewport (user's visible area of a web page). 400vh is 400% of the viewport.</li>
    </ul>
